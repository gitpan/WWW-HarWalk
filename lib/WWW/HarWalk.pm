=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use LWP::UserAgent;
    use WWW::HarWalk qw(walk_har);
    
    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;

    # simple usage
    walk_har($ua, 'c.lietou.com.har');
    
    # with hooks
    walk_har($ua,                 # a LWP::UserAgent instance
         'c.lietou.com.har',      # har file path
         sub {
             my $entry = shift;   # entries item in har
             
             # request of the entry item. Note: this is not the HTTP::Request instance
             my $request = $entry->{request};
             
             # return false to skip this entry
             return 0 if $request->{url} =~ /\.(?:gif|png|css|js)(?:\?.*)?$/;
             
             # must return true to request this entry
             return 1;
         },
         sub {
             # $res is a HTTP::Response intance, decoded
             my ($entry, $res, $entries) = @_;
             
             # you can print or capture something from some response

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 walk_har($ua, $har_file, $before_sub, $after_sub)

Walk through all the entries in the HAR file, and issue each request.

The first two arguments is required. The $ua is a LWP::UserAgent instance, you can do some configuration first, eg: set timeout. $har_file is the HAR file you recorded.

The last two arguments are for hooks. In the before hook you can decide where this request shall be sent, you can return false to skip some unnessary request, such as images, css, etc. The prototype of the before hook is:

    sub {
        my ($entry) = @_;
        return 1;
    }

The after hook is for people to get some information from the response. Eg: get some link to download and push them into @$entries. It is prototype is :

    sub {
        my ($entry, $res, $entries) = @_;
    }

The $entry is the item in the entries array in the HAR file ( log -> entries ). The $res is a decoded HTTP::Response instance.
